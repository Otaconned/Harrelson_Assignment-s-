<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><b>Sam</b> is a <em>transfer junior</em> pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is specifically interested in software development, data analytics, and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>He</b> is attending this course as it is a required step in the pathway toward understanding programming and development. Additionally, he enjoyed a previous course which taught cursory HTML, and wanted to continue learning the subject thoroughly.</p>

<p><b>His</b> personal goals for this class include staying ahead of coursework, including alloting an appropriate amount of time each week to accomplish assignments, review notes, and attend office hours. In his eyes, it is better to be over-prepared than under-prepared, especially when it comes to academia.</p>
